 Jagruk – A Social-Powered Disaster Management App
🌍 Overview
Jagruk (meaning alert or aware in Hindi) is a community-driven disaster management app that works like a social media platform during emergencies. It allows users to share real-time updates, request help, find shelters, and stay informed during natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones.

The goal is simple: connect people and enable fast, community-based disaster response — even when official channels are slow or unavailable.

🎯 Why We Built Jagruk
During natural disasters, access to real-time, local information and the ability to request help can save lives. But most people don’t know what’s happening in their surroundings — or how to respond.

Jagruk empowers individuals to:
Share live updates from affected areas
Request or offer help to others nearby
Stay connected through a familiar, social-media-like interface
See live maps and alerts issued by authorities or verified users

🔑 Key Features
🧭 Live Community Feed
Share real-time disaster updates from your area (e.g., road blockages, water levels, safe zones).
🆘 One-Tap SOS Alerts
Send your location and emergency type (e.g., medical, shelter, rescue) instantly.
📍 Disaster Map View
View posts, SOS requests, and shelters on an interactive map.
📢 Official Broadcasts
Verified government accounts can issue alerts and warnings to all users.
💬 Community Interaction
Comment, like, and respond to posts — just like on Instagram or Twitter — but for saving lives.
🎖️ Verified Volunteer Tags
Trusted users are marked to improve the reliability of shared information.
📚 Emergency Preparedness Tips
In-app safety guides for floods, earthquakes, fires, and more.

👥 Who Can Use Jagruk?
🌆 Citizens in affected regions
🧑‍🚒 Rescue teams & volunteers
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Families & friends trying to stay in touch
🏢 Authorities needing to broadcast official alerts
🧓 Even non-technical users can operate Jagruk easily — it’s as simple as using WhatsApp or Facebook.

🚀 Why Jagruk Stands Out
Unlike traditional alert systems, Jagruk is built with a human-first approach — encouraging users to help each other while staying informed. It's a combination of social media, emergency response, and real-time location updates — all in one app that puts community first.
